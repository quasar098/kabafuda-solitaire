# kabafuda solitaire
(from last call bbs)

the assets are ripped from last call bbs

the game is about piracy anyway so i think this is the correct usage of last call bbs

## how to play:

### goal:

get all of the same numbered card ontop of each other

### important:

- in regular solitaire you alternate colors and stack them in descending order.
here, you group them up with the same card (all 1s together, all 2s together, etc)

- you cannot take a complete stack (4 of the same) by itself and move it. 
it is locked into place forever

- also, there is no undo move. the entire point of the game is to
plan ahead of time your moves

- this game is treeware. that's "tree" ware, not free ware.
if you enjoyed the game, plant a tree near you (and recommend last call bbs to a friend)

### free slots:

this depends on difficulty

- expert starts with 1 free slots
- hard starts with 2 free slots
- normal starts with 3 free slots
- easy starts with all 4 free slots

you can unlock free slots by making complete stacks by themselves 
in the bottom 8 slots (not the top 4)
